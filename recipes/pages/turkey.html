  <h2><em>Description</em></h2>
  <p>This recipe is for a herb-glazed roasted turkey. You are free to make your own stuffing on the side and serve in a festive dish. </p>
  <h2><em>Ingredients</em></h2>
  <ul>
    <li>1 (16 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed </li>
    <li>¼ cup extra-virgin olive oil </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>½ teaspoon ground black pepper </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground thyme </li>
    <li>1 cup honey </li>
    <li>½ cup melted butter </li>
    <li>2 teaspoons dried sage leaves </li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh parsley </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon dried basil </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
    <li>1 teaspoon ground black peppe</li>
  </ul>
  <h2><em>Steps</em></h2>
  <ol>
    <li>Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C). Rinse the turkey, and pat thoroughly dry with paper towels. Brush the turkey with olive oil, inside and out.</li>
    <li>Mix 1 teaspoon of salt, 1/2 teaspoon of pepper, and the thyme in a small bowl, and sprinkle the turkey with the mixture.</li>
    <li>Place the turkey on a rack set in a roasting pan, and roast in the preheated oven for 2 hours.</li>
    <li>In a bowl, stir together the honey, melted butter, sage, parsley, basil, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1 teaspoon pepper, until the mixture is smooth and well blended. Brush the turkey with the honey glaze, and return to the oven.</li>
    <li>Roast the turkey until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 2 more hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone should read 180 degrees F (82 degrees C). Continue to brush the turkey with the honey glaze frequently as it roasts. Remove the turkey from the oven, cover with a doubled sheet of aluminum foil, and allow to rest in a warm area 10 to 15 minutes before slicing.</li>
